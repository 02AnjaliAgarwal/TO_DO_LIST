# Project Name : Your To-Do's
## Project Description: Building a Dynamic To-Do List with Local Storage. 
In this minimalistic JavaScript project, I’ve created a dynamic To-Do list web application that simplifies task management. 

## Key-Features

### 1. Adding Tasks
Users can easily add tasks to their list. Simply type the task description into the input box and click the “Add” button.
The new task will instantly appear in the list, ready for action.
Tasks can be marked as complete or incomplete by simply clicking on their names, providing a quick way to track progress.

### 2. Local Storage Integration
When users add or modify tasks, the application stores this information directly in their web browser.
Even if they close the browser or restart their computer, their saved To-Do list remains intact.
This feature ensures continuity and convenience, allowing users to pick up where they left off.

### 3.User-Friendly Interface
The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing users to focus on their tasks without unnecessary distractions.
Tasks are displayed in a clear and organized manner, with easy-to-use controls for adding, marking, and deleting tasks.
